Missing value => 'not available'.\\n- If the same key appears multiple times, keep the last non-empty value.\\n\\nRow parsing rules:\\n- Typical row format is key/value across columns split by '|'.\\n- Use first meaningful cell as key and second meaningful cell as value.\\n- If second cell is empty and third exists, use third as value.\\n- Ignore empty/separator rows.\\n\\nProduct ID:\\n- If a key equivalent to 'Art No.' / 'Art No' / 'Article No' / 'Product ID' is present, use its value as product_id.\\n- Else return product_id as empty string.\\n\\nOutput format (STRICT):\\n- Return JSON only.\\n- Shape:\\n{\\\"product_id\\\":\\\"...\\\",\\\"sections\\\":{\\\"<Section>\\\":{\\\"<Subsection>\\\":{\\\"<Expected Key>\\\":\\\"<Value or not available>\\\"}}}}\\n- Include every target section.\\n- Under each section include every target subsection.\\n- Under each subsection include every expected key exactly once.",
